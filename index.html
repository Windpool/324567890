        <h2><u> Why I started </u></h2>
        <p style="cursor: wait">I always had a passion for doing the things that are inevitable, or something that is more than the reach of simple/smart minds. Other times, I just do things to know them. I feel like I can win in every way if I know them. Other times I learn things which might be 0.01% important to me, now or later. For example, I still remember a time when I learned noman numerals, absolutely for no reason. It is these small things--as well as other major aspects--differencient me from someone else. Right now though, I am not my usual self. In school, I was a kid who has earned a special award 6 times, while some people haven’t gotten it even once. Even the popular kids--according to grades. The generally popular kids are the ones with lower dominance and “power” than me. (I don’t care about grammar at this point.) It’s not like I had any “legal” power, or anything. But its the vibe of heroism as someone confident, and admired by many, like me pass people. My grades weren’t perfect. But, it was my attitude of being brave and standing up against the wrong that has gotten me here. Literally, there is only one award that I haven’t gotten in Middle School. The crazy part is, I’ve gotten them the first time they were given out. (Although I didn’t get the very rare ones multiple times, I did get everything that anyone could have gotten (no clubs awards, etc.) I didn’t go for them, and I act normally even where I get them. Over time, I got used to it. It is important to note that I don’t brag about stuff I have gotten. I talk as much as necessary, when someone brings it up. This Pandemic is changing my personality a lot. I am a person that needs people to talk to. Without that, and the will to do most of the things right now, I am not dominating and challenging the topic. Instead of accepting it. Kidding! I am always the person with the perception of a winner, no matter what the outside world thinks, because I don’t a s*** about the society (not all, but some). That’s it for now, I will update this later...</p>
